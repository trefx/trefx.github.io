Note for website editors:

index.html (aka /trusted-wfrun-crate/) redirects to /5s-crate/

0.3 contains the archived version of Trusted Workflow Run Crate 0.3 before it was renamed to Five Safes RO-Crate.
As this contains multiple examples these are not copied. Note that the index.html there is a snapshot from Jekyll.

0.3-DRAFT/ redirects to 0.3/

0.1-DRAFT/ 0.2-DRAFT/ and 0.4-DRAFT/ redirect to their /5s-crate/ counterparts
which are maintained in separate repo https://github.com/trefx/5s-crate/
