_Delivering a federated network of TREs to enable safe analytics_

TRE-FX was a project funded in 2023 by [UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)](https://www.ukri.org/) as part of the [‚ÄúDARE UK (Data and Analytics Research Environments UK)‚Äù](https://dareuk.org.uk/) programme ([MC_PC_23007](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MC_PC_23007)).


## Motivation

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure locations in which data are placed
for researchers to analyse. They host administrative data, hospital data or any other
data that must be securely isolated and only accessible for approved queries by
approved researchers. 

However, _it is hard for a researcher to perform analysis across
multiple TREs_, for example when data is to be analysed across geographical or
governance boundaries, such as the devolved nature of healthcare in the United
Kingdom. _Yet this ability is urgently needed_. 

Analysis across a federation of TREs
would enable timely analysis of UK wide scattered data to answer urgent questions,
as we needed in the COVID-19 pandemic. The technologies and standards we need to be able to do this are available now. They
do not need to be invented. 

**TRE-FX** assembled leading technology providers from
[ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), 
with three TRE providers and two leading analysis platforms
to show through a real reference implementation how we can use secure Research
Objects to move between TREs while still following the **Five Safes framework** that
govern and protect patient data; all overseen by patient representatives.

The impact will be a step change for how researchers can safely combine data from
many sources, and for how data providers from any sector can safely implement this
using technology and standards we already have today.

## Next steps

The work on Federated Analytics and Five Safes Crate is carried forward by the HDR UK [Federated Analytics](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/research/research-data-infrastructure/federated-analytics/) programme. See also the [Fed-A project pages](https://fed-a.org/).

The Five Safes Crate will be used by EOSC projects [EOSC-ENTRUST](https://esciencelab.org.uk/projects/eosc-entrust/) and [EVERSE](https://everse.software/) as part of secure workflow execution with [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend).
