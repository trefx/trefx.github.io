[TRE-FX](https://trefx.uk/) is a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) as part of the DARE UK (Data and Analytics Research Environments UK) programme. 

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure locations in which data are placed for researchers to analyse. They host administrative data, hospital data or any other data that must be securely isolated and only accessible for approved queries by approved researchers.

TRE-FX is assembling leading technology providers from [ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), with three TRE providers and two leading analysis platforms to show through a real reference implementation how we can use secure Research Objects to move between TREs, while still supporting the **Five Safes principles** that govern and protect patient data; all overseen by patient representatives.

In this **virtual stakeholder workshop** we will show the proposed TRE-FX architecture and corresponding data model, and collect feedback and requirements in order to modify the approach so it can be implemented by the majority of TREs in the UK in order to support a broad and interoperable federated workflow execution within the constraints of the Five Safes principles.

As a stakeholder attending this workshop, you will have the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the proposed TRE-FX architecture and data model. This event will provide a comprehensive understanding of the initiative's goals and how it plans to address technical implementation challenges. It will also serves as a crucial platform for you to contribute your feedback and requirements. Your input will directly influence the refinement and modification of the approach, ensuring that the implemented solution can be widely adopted by the majority of TREs in the UK. This emphasis on stakeholder engagement aims to create an inclusive framework that supports interoperability and collaboration across different research environments, promoting seamless data sharing and analysis.

By participating in the workshop, you will play a significant role in shaping the future of secure data sharing and analysis in the research community. The ultimate goal of TRE-FX is to establish a framework that enables secure data sharing, seamless movement of research objects, and federated analysis while prioritising the privacy and security of data. By attending and providing your feedback, you can actively contribute to the development of a robust and trusted infrastructure that supports your organisation's research objectives.
