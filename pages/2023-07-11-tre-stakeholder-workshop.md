# Approaching Five Safes with TRE-FX Trusted Workflow Run Crate

## TRE-FX Virtual Stakeholder Workshop

* **When**: 11th July 2023 14:00 – 16:30 BST
* **Where**: Zoom (by registration)
* **Invitees**: Open to all, in particular stakeholders of UK-based Trusted Research Environment for health data 

[TRE-FX](https://trefx.uk/) is a project funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) as part of the DARE UK (Data and Analytics Research Environments UK) programme. 

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure locations in which data are placed for researchers to analyse. They host administrative data, hospital data or any other data that must be securely isolated and only accessible for approved queries by approved researchers.

TRE-FX assembled leading technology providers from [ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), with three TRE providers and two leading analysis platforms to show through a real reference implementation how we can use secure Research Objects to move between TREs, while still supporting the **Five Safes framework** that govern and protect patient data; all overseen by patient representatives.

In this **virtual stakeholder workshop** we showed the proposed TRE-FX architecture and corresponding data model, and collected feedback and requirements in order to modify the approach so it can be implemented by the majority of TREs in the UK in order to support a broad and interoperable federated workflow execution within the constraints of the Five Safes.

Stakeholders attending this workshop had the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the proposed TRE-FX architecture and data model. This event provided a comprehensive understanding of the initiative's goals and how it plans to address technical implementation challenges. It served as a crucial platform to contribute feedback and requirements. This input will directly influence the refinement and modification of the approach, ensuring that the implemented solution can be widely adopted by the majority of TREs in the UK. This emphasis on stakeholder engagement aims to create an inclusive framework that supports interoperability and collaboration across different research environments, promoting seamless data sharing and analysis.

Participants in the workshop play a significant role in shaping the future of secure data sharing and analysis in the research community. The ultimate goal of TRE-FX is to establish a framework that enables secure data sharing, seamless movement of research objects, and federated analysis while prioritising the privacy and security of data. Those attending and providing feedback actively contributed to the development of a robust and trusted infrastructure that supports their organisation's research objectives.
