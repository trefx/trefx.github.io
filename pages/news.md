The TRE-FX architecture team gathered in Nottingham for a end-to-end hackathon that put together a proof of concept implementation that given a [Hutch](https://hdruk.github.io/hutch) CWL workflow executed it in a TRE pod, using the workflow execution service WfExS which [output](https://trefx.uk/trusted-wfrun-crate/0.3/example-hutch/data/ro-crate-preview.html) was transformed to a [Trusted Workflow Run Crate](https://trefx.uk/trusted-wfrun-crate/). This inform the RO-Crate profile, as well as the TRE-FX architecture.
